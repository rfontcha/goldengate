# Create and configure the pipeline

## Introduction
This lab instructs you to create a pipeline. 

Estimated time: 25 minutes

### About pipelines
A pipeline is an instance of a recipe. It enables you to select your source connection, the type of replication action(s) to apply, and the target connection. After creating the pipeline, you can configure which schemas and tables to replicate to the target. After the pipeline starts, you can observe the replication process in real time.
